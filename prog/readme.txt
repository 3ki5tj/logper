log.ma            logisitic map

cub.ma            cubic map

cub0.ma/cub0d.ma  cub0.ma is similar to cub.ma, but it does not remove divisors
                  cub0d.ma removes the divisors of the output of cub0.ma
                  this protocol seems to be more robust

hen.ma            Henon map

mkinterp.py       interpolation code

mknsolv.py        numerical solution code
