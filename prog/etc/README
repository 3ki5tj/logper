logres.ma     A Mathematica script that computes the boundary polynomials
              of the logistic map using the resultant
              e.g.,
                math < res.ma 6 a
              works for the onset of 6-cycle. Its performance sucks.

math4vim.txt  how to highlight .ma files in Vim.

div14.ma      factorize the 14-cycle onset polynomial

trimnsolv.py  reads `nsolv.txt', write an output that can be appended at the end of
              the polynomial file like `T13a.txt'


bmp.ma        Convert polynomial coefficients to bytes (text file).
bmp.c         Convert the output of `bmp.ma' to a .bmp picture.
