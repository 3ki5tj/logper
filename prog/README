log.ma            logisitic map, f(x) = R - x^2

cub.ma            antisymmetric cubic map f(x) = r x - x^3

cub2.ma           solve a transformed map f(u) = r^2 u (1 - u)^2
                  which encompasses both cycles and half-cycles
                  of the antisymmetric cubic map

hen.ma            Henon map

lsfit.ma          specialized script to fit a polynomial from a list of
                  integer values
                  it is able to detect some corruptions

mkinterp.py       (deprecated) same purpose as lsfit.ma
                  for log.ma/cub.ma, use lsfit.ma instead
                  however, it is still useful for hen.ma

mknsolv.py        numerical solution code

/old
cub0.ma/cub0d.ma  cub0.ma is similar to cub.ma, but it does not remove divisors
                  cub0d.ma removes the divisors of the output of cub0.ma
                  this protocol seems to be more robust

cubh.ma           solve the half-cycle polynomial without using cyclic polynomials

extra.nb          additional and old code snippets



For log.ma and cub.ma,
the command-line argument "C" is faster than "c" for larger n.
