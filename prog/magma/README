Magma programs
==============

Groebner Basis
--------------

log*.magma are prewritten scripts Groebner basis routines for Magma

To run it
  magma < log8b.magma

Other scripts for the logistic map and cubic map can be generated
  from the Python script mkgb.py

For the general 8-cycle of the simplified logistic map:
  python mkgb.py -R 8 c > R8c.magma
Then call magma
  magma < R8c.magma

For the bifurcation 7-cycle of the original logistic map:
  python mkgb.py -r 7 b

For the onset 5-cycle of the cubic map:
  python mkgb.py -c 5 a




Determinant routines
--------------------

Magma is not very efficient in computing the determinant.

Convert the matrix to magma format, calling the determinant routine there,
  slower than Mathematica
The matsX.dat file is generated as a byproduct of, e.g., log.ma

  python ./mats2magma.py mats8.dat > a.magma

then in Magma
> load a.magma;
> f;

numbthy.py
    collects some basic number theory routines in Python
    mat2magma.py uses numbthy.py
