Manuscript corrections
-----------------------
The following error exists in the manuscript resubmitted to ijbc
  J_n(x_1) = J(x_n) ... J(x_1)
instead of
  J_n(x_1) = J(x_1) ... J(x_n)


TODO
-----
  * (PARTIALLY) improve the onset factorization
  * (PARTIALLY) redo the degR
  * add discussion of even poly of r at n = 4, 8 for the cubic map
  * discuss that the cyclic polynomial is the minimal basis
  * add the necklace references (book)
